// Represents the geometry of a given lane in a Cartesian coordinate system where the
// lane's reference point (per MAP/GID spec) is the origin.  Coordinates are in east (+x)
// and north (+y) centimeters from the origin.  The lane's geometry is composed of points
// that represent the MAP nodes (points) and line segments that connect those points such that
// they are physically laid out and indexed like this:
//
// Ref pt    P0     S0      P1  S1   P2   S2    P[N-1]  S[N-1]   PN
//    +       +--------------+--------+-------...-+--------------+
//
// where P0 is the lane's stop bar.  Note that the reference point may not necessarily be
// in the center of the stop box, or even in the stop box at all.  This diagram simply
// clarifies that it is near P0 somewhere, and not part of the lane centerline.
//
// The term "downtrack" refers to items closer to the stop bar than the location in question
// (uses the context of a vehicle traveling toward the intersection, so this seems backwards
// if referring to an egress lane).
